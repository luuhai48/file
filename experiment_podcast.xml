</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2022/05/fighting-remember-mississippi-burning/629913/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In June 1964, at the height of the civil-rights movement, the Ku Klux Klan burned a Black Methodist church to the ground in the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi, and murdered three civil-rights workers in cold blood. This crime became one of the most notorious of its era, shocking the nation on the eve of the passage of the Civil Rights Act and later inspiring a Hollywood blockbuster: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mississippi Burning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when the reporter Ko Bragg started questioning how this history is being preserved in Philadelphia, she was confronted with a town that would much rather forget its violent past. Bragg finds a few Black residents taking it upon themselves to keep the story of this crime alive, and she asks where the burden of safeguarding history should lie. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2022/05/uyghur-teen-escape-from-genocide-china/629837/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At 19 years old, Aséna Tahir Izgil feels wise beyond her years. She is Uyghur, an ethnic minority persecuted in China, and few of her people have escaped to bear witness. After narrowly securing refuge in the United States, Aséna’s now tasked with adjusting to life in a new country and fitting in with her teenage peers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge Judy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, one of the most popular and influential television &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ever made. Over its decades-long run, it beat out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; in ratings, led to the explosion of court TV, and influenced how large swaths of Americans think about crime and justice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s Peter Bresnan has been watching &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judge Judy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;with his mom ever since he was a kid. But recently, he began to wonder how the show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;managed to become such a force in American culture, and what impact it’s had on the thousands of litigants who stood before Judy’s TV bench. What he found was a strange story about what happens when the line between law and entertainment starts to blur. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2022/04/resurgence-abortion-underground/629642/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a common story about abortion in this country, that people have only two options to intentionally end a pregnancy: the clinic or the coat hanger. They can choose the safe route that’s protected by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roe v. Wade—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;a doctor in a legal clinic—or, if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is overturned, endure a dangerous back-alley abortion, symbolized by the coat hanger. But a close look at the history of abortion in this country shows that there’s much more to this story. As the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case that could overturn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roe v Wade &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;in June, activists are once again preparing to take abortion into their own hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporter Jessica Bruder explores the abortion underground to learn about the movement’s origins, and reveals how activists today are mobilizing around effective and medically safe abortion methods that can be done at home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when she applied for citizenship in the Cherokee Nation as an adult, she was denied. What followed was a journey into a dark part of Cherokee history that not many people know about and even fewer understand: Vann and her family are descended from people who were enslaved by the Cherokee Nation. They were freed after the Civil War, but that wasn’t the end of their struggle. In 1866, the Cherokee Nation made a promise—a promise of citizenship for these “freedmen” and their descendants.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/helen-keller-tiktok-conspiracy-fraud/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fantasy writer Elsa Sjunneson has been haunted by Helen Keller for nearly her entire life. Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up, she couldn’t escape the constant comparisons. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming that Keller was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly, Sjunneson found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Keller’s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she’d ever dreamed she would be. For more than a year, Sjunneson, Lulu Miller, and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; team dug through primary sources, talked with experts, even visited Keller’s birthplace, Ivy Green, and discovered that the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious, and confounding than the simple myth of a young deaf-blind girl rescued by her teacher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This story originally ran on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/ashes-lawn"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This week, The Experiment tells the story of the Holocaust survivor Ethel Kaplan, and traces Franklin Foer’s own journey—how he once came to believe Putin’s myth, and his journey to Ukraine to debunk it.

Julia and her cousins all knew not to tell grandma when they were sick, or they’d risk being slathered with “Vickicito.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/experiment/spam/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;SPAM is at the center of one of the longest and most contentious labor battles in U.S. history. In 1985, workers at the Hormel Foods plant in Austin, Minnesota, went on strike, demanding better working conditions and stable wages. Generations of meatpackers had worked at the plant, some for most of their lives—and that gruesome, difficult work afforded them a sustainable, middle-class life. So when that way of life was threatened, they fought back. SPAM boycotts spread to cities and towns around the world. The strike went on for almost two years, pit neighbor against neighbor, and turned violent; the National Guard was called in to protect those who crossed the picket line. In the end, the strike is a Rorschach test: either a lesson in what is possible when workers unite, or a cautionary tale about biting the SPAM that feeds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode is the second in a new three-part miniseries from&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/experiment/spam/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;SPAM: How the American Dream Got Canned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In 1985, workers at the Hormel Foods plant in Austin, Minnesota, went on strike, demanding better working conditions and stable wages. Generations of meatpackers had worked at the plant, some for most of their lives—and that gruesome, difficult work afforded them a sustainable, middle-class life. So when that way of life was threatened, they fought back. SPAM boycotts spread to cities and towns around the world. The strike went on for almost two years, pit neighbor against neighbor, and turned violent; the National Guard was called in to protect those who crossed the picket line. In the end, the strike is a Rorschach test: either a lesson in what is possible when workers unite, or a cautionary tale about biting the SPAM that feeds. </p>

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/experiment/spam/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During World War II, wherever American troops spread democracy, they left the canned meat known as SPAM in its wake. When American GIs landed overseas, they often tossed cans of SPAM out of trucks to the hungry people they sought to liberate. That’s how producer Gabrielle Berbey’s grandfather first came to know and love SPAM as a kid in the Philippines. But 80 years later, SPAM no longer feels American. It is now a staple Filipino food: a  beloved emblem of Filipino identity. Gabrielle sets out on a journey to understand how SPAM made its way into the hearts of generations of Pacific Islanders, and ends up opening a SPAM can of worms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Walker was head of the D.C. National Guard. He had buses full of guardsmen in riot gear ready to deploy in case Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally turned dangerous. But when rioters violently stormed the Capitol building, the Guard was nowhere to be found. Walker says he was forced to wait for three hours before his superiors allowed him to send in his troops. “My soldiers were asking me, ‘Sir, what the hell is going on?’” Walker says. “‘Are they watching the news? Are they watching what’s going on at the Capitol?’ And I had no answer. I don’t recall ever being in that position, where I did not have an answer for my soldiers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, almost one year later, Walker is the sergeant-at-arms of the U.S. House of Representatives—the first Black man to ever hold that office. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s correspondent Tracie Hunte and producer Peter Bresnan visit Walker in his new office at the Capitol to ask him about what happened on January 6, and what he’s doing to make sure it never happens again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We consider how the felony-murder rule disproportionately punishes youth of color and women, and the debate over whether the same rule is key to holding police officers responsible in the killings of civilians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/11/rebecca-hall-racial-identity-passing-film-netflix/620745/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hollywood has a long history of “passing movies”—films in which Black characters pass for white—usually starring white actors. Even as these films have attempted to depict the devastating effect of racism in America, they have trafficked in tired tropes about Blackness. But a new movie from actor-writer-director Rebecca Hall takes the problematic conventions of this uniquely American genre and turns them on their head. Hall tells the story of how her movie came to life, and how making the film helped her grapple with her own family’s secrets around race and identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week without responses, the management professor Yusuf Ahmed Nur stepped forward.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The writer Jennifer Senior’s brother was Bobby’s roommate when he died, and in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/twenty-years-gone-911-bobby-mcilvaine/619490/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cover story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s September issue, she visited with each member of the family to understand their personal journey through the aftermath of national tragedy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The McIlvaines very early on saw a grief counselor,” Senior tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s host, Julia Longoria, “who said to them: ‘Here’s how you have to think about this. You are all at the top of a mountain, and you all have a broken leg, and you all have to get down to the bottom of the mountain. But because you all have broken legs, you just have to take care of your own self and figure out how to get down.’” In this story, Senior explores how each family member dealt with their grief in very different ways. “But there might be a flaw in that metaphor too,” she says, “because, you know, some people never get down the mountain.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode’s guests include the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; staff writer Jennifer Senior and Helen McIlvaine, Bob McIlvaine Sr., and Jeff McIlvaine, the family of Bobby McIlvaine Jr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/08/uyghur-genocide-china-us-immigrant/619806/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here in the United States, 19-year-old Aséna Tahir Izgil feels as though she’s a “grandma.” Aséna is Uyghur, an ethnic minority being imprisoned in labor camps by the Chinese government. The pain she witnessed before escaping in 2017 has aged her beyond her years, she says, making it hard to relate to American teenagers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They talk about … TikToks … clothing, malls, games, movies, and stuff,” she says. “And then the things I think about [are] genocide, Uyghurs, international policies … all the annoying adult facts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the Chinese government has been persecuting her people, but few have escaped to bear witness. This week on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Aséna shares her family’s story of fleeing to the U.S. to escape genocide, adjusting to newfound freedom, and trying to deal with the grief and guilt of being a refugee.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode’s guests include Aséna Tahir Izgil and her father, Tahir Hamut Izgil, a Uyghur poet and author.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;torn away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A piece of my bone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the lines of time grow long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her black eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;float the truths of stone tablets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;an omen trickling from history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;kisses the stone on my grave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;that holds down my corpse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/08/usa-gymnastics-abuse-2021-olympics/619731/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ever since Kerri Strug and the Magnificent Seven won Olympic gold in 1996, the U.S. women’s gymnastics team has been a point of pride for many Americans. But over the past five years, athletes have been coming forward with allegations of widespread abuse in the sport. Former gymnasts say they were forced to train and compete with broken bones and that they were denied food. And dozens of women have testified that they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar, the former doctor who worked with the U.S. national team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;USA Gymnastics, the governing body for elite gymnastics in the United States, has said it’s working hard to change the sport’s culture, but many former gymnasts say it hasn’t done enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have coaches and institutions and organizations and a country, frankly, that prioritize money and medals over the bodies and souls of people,” says Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast who was the first woman to come forward publicly with accusations against Nassar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that we know the truth about how damaging elite gymnastics can be for young women and girls, should we change how we think about the sport? Denhollander says Simone Biles’s decision to withdraw from several Olympic events might change how athletes see their own worth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That’s going to entail a lot of hard conversations,” Denhollander says. “Do you have value and identity and worth outside of your gymnastics ability? If we really, truly understand that the answer to that is yes, that lays the foundation to be able to say, ‘I can’t sacrifice my value, identity, the rest of my life for this one thing.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: When national glory comes at the expense of young women’s bodies, can we still find a way to love the Olympics?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But over the past five years, athletes have been coming forward with allegations of widespread abuse in the sport. Former gymnasts say they were forced to train and compete with broken bones and that they were denied food. And dozens of women have testified that they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar, the former doctor who worked with the U.S. national team. </p>
<p>USA Gymnastics, the governing body for elite gymnastics in the United States, has said it’s working hard to change the sport’s culture, but many former gymnasts say it hasn’t done enough.</p>
<p>“We have coaches and institutions and organizations and a country, frankly, that prioritize money and medals over the bodies and souls of people,” says Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast who was the first woman to come forward publicly with accusations against Nassar. </p>
<p>Now that we know the truth about how damaging elite gymnastics can be for young women and girls, should we change how we think about the sport? Denhollander says Simone Biles’s decision to withdraw from several Olympic events might change how athletes see their own worth. </p>
<p>“That’s going to entail a lot of hard conversations,” Denhollander says. “Do you have value and identity and worth outside of your gymnastics ability? If we really, truly understand that the answer to that is yes, that lays the foundation to be able to say, ‘I can’t sacrifice my value, identity, the rest of my life for this one thing.’” </p>

The only problem, according to the writer and journalist Bryan Burrough, is that this founding legend isn’t all true. In June, Burrough and two other Texan writers set out to debunk the myth of the Alamo, only to find themselves in an unexpected battle with Texans still trying to protect their state’s revered origin story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Anglo power structure here, which still dominates politics and the media,” Burrough says, “can clearly see that if the myth melts away, other things could begin to melt away as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The only problem, according to the writer and journalist Bryan Burrough, is that this founding legend isn’t all true. In June, Burrough and two other Texan writers set out to debunk the myth of the Alamo, only to find themselves in an unexpected battle with Texans still trying to protect their state’s revered origin story. “The Anglo power structure here, which still dominates politics and the media,” Burrough says, “can clearly see that if the myth melts away, other things could begin to melt away as well.” This week on The Experiment: how a history book ignited a ferocious debate over Texas’s founding legend, and how this battle climbed the ranks all the way up to the Texas GOP.   This episode’s guest is Bryan Burrough, a co-author of Forget the Alamo: The Rise and Fall of an American Myth.

The decision may have seemed relatively small, but in this episode of the Experiment podcast, the Atlantic staff writer Adam Harris explains how it could change the way we think about college athletes. College sports rake in billions of dollars a year for schools. But athletes themselves have historically been barred from making money by the NCAA in order to preserve their amateur status. “Amateurism” has long been a central idea of college athletics: Student athletes play for the love of the game and an education, never for compensation. The myth (and marketing) of the “student athlete” have grown over the past century, but starting in 2010, a scandal gradually shifted how the country saw college sports. This week on The Experiment: The Atlantic staff writer and former college-basketball player Adam Harris explains how the myth of the amateur athlete was created, and why it may finally be on its way out. This episode’s guests include Adam Harris, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Andy Thomason, an assistant managing editor at The Chronicle of Higher Education and the author of Discredited; Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA football player and the executive director of the National College Players Association; Mary Willingham, a former student-athlete academic adviser and whistleblower at the University of North Carolina.

But the recent COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act has spurred resistance from an unexpected source: activist groups that represent the people these laws are meant to protect. This week on The Experiment, our correspondent, Tracie Hunte, investigates the 150-year history of legislating against racist violence in the U.S. and asks: Have we been policing hate all wrong?   This episode’s guests include Jami Floyd, WNYC’s senior editor for race and justice; Saida Grundy, an assistant professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University; Jason Wu, a co-chair of the LGBTQ advocacy group GAPIMNY; Jeannine Bell, a professor of law at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law; and Sunayana Dumala, the founder of Forever Welcome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the face of death, grief, and indifference, what can people do to make a change? In trying to understand a year of tragedy and conflict, correspondent Tracie Hunte looks back 30 years to explore the U.S. AIDS epidemic and how protesters balanced rage and anguish with pointed and often painstaking political action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we hear from AIDS activists who put their bodies on the line and from the man they burned in effigy, Anthony Fauci. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/05/evangelical-politics-lost-faith/618909/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Lecrae Moore came up in a Christian culture deeply entwined with politics: Evangelicals were Republicans, and Republicans were evangelicals. As a Black college student, he found a sense of belonging in Bible study. His mentors and community were predominantly white and very conservative, but that didn’t really bother him. He found success as an artist and built a career in the white evangelical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, though, he began to notice how much politics influenced his church culture. He was inspired by Barack Obama’s election, but felt unable to share that with his evangelical audiences. He was disturbed by the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, but faced backlash on social media for saying so. He started writing lyrics about race and the hypocrisy he saw among Christians, who he felt paid lip service to diversity but didn’t form substantive relationships with other communities. When he saw how strongly the evangelical world was going to champion Donald Trump, he decided to speak out. He lost money and fans, friends and mentors. And he almost lost his faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White evangelicals have arguably never been more powerful as a political force in America than they are now, but political victory has a human cost. People of all kinds of backgrounds have felt gutted by Christian support for Trump. Among Christians, the Trump era’s legacy might be fracture, not unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Experiment&lt;/em&gt;: the story of an evangelical artist who found his voice and lost his church.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/05/evangelicals-republican-voters/618845/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These days, everyone assumes that this is just a fact of life: Evangelicals are Republicans, and Republicans are evangelicals. The powerful alliance culminated in the 2016 election of Donald Trump, tying the reputation of Christianity in America to the Trump brand—maybe permanently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It wasn’t always like this. One man—a political operative from Georgia named Ralph Reed—devised a plan to harness the energy of young Christians and turn them into America’s most powerful voting bloc, one church mailing list at a time. Decades later, when Donald Trump came on the political scene, Reed knew he would be big—and convinced his fellow evangelicals that they should give him a shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s election was everything Reed spent his entire career fighting for: a president who was anti–abortion rights, listened to evangelical leaders, and advocated for Christians who felt pushed out of the public square. But Reed’s victory had a cost. Many, many Christians have come to feel that their church cares more about politics than Jesus. They have spoken out. They have grieved. And some of them have left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Experiment&lt;/em&gt;, we have the first episode in a two-part series: Meet the man who turned a disparate group of evangelicals into America’s most powerful voting bloc and invented the evangelical political brand. Then join us next week for Part 2, when we’ll look at the human cost of political victory—a cost that might ultimately be very high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lessons From '90 Day Fiancé'
</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/05/reality-tv-us-immigration/618775/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dating shows often push contestants to extreme measures in pursuit of love. Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; But on TLC’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/90-day-fiance/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn’t need to dream up a deadline: It’s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa—the “fiancé visa”—which allows a U.S. citizen’s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it’s intersecting with class and sexuality,” says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=fsg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Felicity Amaya Schaeffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A transcript of this episode is presented below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playfully plucky marimba-and-horn music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracie Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, to begin, I am going to send you a link. It’s a little bit long—it’s like seven minutes or so—’cause this is your first time watching &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, anything having to do with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s correct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay, okay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m just curious, like, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;why&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Insistently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;) Watch the clip, Julia! (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs, and Longoria joins in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay. So, Julia, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a wildly popular show on TLC. It’s about couples who are international—like, it’s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas—and I want to begin your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay. I’m gonna—do I hit play?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes. Hit play!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;My name is Colt. I’m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we’re at the airport, and we’re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together—to Cancun, I think—and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;After one date they decided to get married?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, effectively one date. So what we’re doing right now is that we’re meeting Larissa for the first time. She’s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;First impressions of Las Vegas, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is hot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It’s going to get a little hotter too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;First of all, she’s hot. [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Longoria chuckles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;] It’s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I’ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;] and I know which one I vastly prefer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A beat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thought that was more big, you know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s pretty big.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like New York.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Las Vegas is also this thing that’s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ocean’s 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Like, you get this idea that it’s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, “American dreams.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Totally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blah, blah, blah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like, casinos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exactly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It’s not like the—the movies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She’s still very hot. She’s still very uncomfortable. And she’s like, “Oh, here’s the sign!” And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It’s on postcards, it’s on magnets, it’s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, ’cause I also didn’t realize it was that small. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, no! I’m sorry. It’s—here’s so warm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Sighs.) Not in my American dream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So yeah. I think that there’s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it’s, like, way bigger than that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, it’s called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;because, if you’re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fiancé visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so—at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I’m sure it’s different for a lot of couples—you’re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what you’re saying, like, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a TV show based around this one piece—or, really, like, this one clause—in U.S. immigration policy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I—I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I’ve always … The thing I don’t like about reality shows is that, like, they’re sort of contrived. It’s like, “Oh, 90 days to fall in love.” And it’s like, “That’s not the way the world works.” But, in this case, it is. [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven’t been watching reality TV, you’ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans’ relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m Julia Longoria. This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Ed: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m Ed. I’m 54 years old. People know me as “Big Ed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Ed: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name “Big Ed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Ed: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s funny because I’m not tall. I am actually 4’11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then there’s Rose, who is much younger. She’s 23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rose Vega: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I’m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;They met on Facebook, and they’ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he’s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family—and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah, okay. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Ed: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I spent the night at Rose’s home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose’s house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Ed: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I’m completely drained. I haven’t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I’ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Music fades out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Hunte giggles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah. So walk me through what’s happening here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, throughout the time that he’s in the Philippines, there’s, like, a scene where he’s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn’t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that’s what’s causing her breath, and she’s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego—something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he’s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she’s in. And he’s already been doing that. He’s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he’s in the Philippines, he’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; completely helpless, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;she’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the one that ends up having to rescue &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; this entire trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it’s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soft, lo-fi music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there’s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Music out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marriage is one of those ways in which women have—for many, many generations and decades—used marriage to get ahead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She’s also the author of the book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Love and Empire. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Way before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; 90 Day Fiancé, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wait, what’s a “vacation romance tour”? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lightly bouncy music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here’s what Felicity discovered. Say you’re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they’ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their weight, how tall they are—all kinds of personal information—and then their contact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then, usually, they’ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it’s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of this that I’m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they’re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America—you know, wherever it is—Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don’t want to usually live in rural areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’d you see when you looked—when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it’s—it’s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don’t have some game. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, “You know, in the United States, I’m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there’s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can’t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hmm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Have you ever watched &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; or heard about it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;You watched it. Okay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to watch too many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte’s narration.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watching &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here’s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colt:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away … Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I’m 31 years old, and I’m from Mechanicsburg,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ashley is in her 30s. She’s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that’s where I met Jay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ashley says she’s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he’s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Ashley admits that she hasn’t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Over slightly tense music.) I’m hoping we don’t have to deal with any racial issues, but I’m also very naive to all of this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don’t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don’t give a f***.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn’t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t want him near me. I don’t even want him in this country. He’s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low percussive music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of this ugliness—this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak—this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A quick, goofy musical flourish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The journey to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a long and winding one. As much as it’s a story about love across borders, it’s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer—she’s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours—told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, “immoral purposes.” And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants—but, more specifically, Chinese women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why were they having them do medical exams?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that’s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing—and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn’t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years—1945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers—who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.—started demanding a more permanent solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it’s like, “Wait, why are these women coming here?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. “What is their motivation for coming here?” I think that’s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senator Alan Simpson: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here’s Senator Alan Simpson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simpson: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous—very generous—legal immigration laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn’t get a permanent green card until after you’d been married for at least two years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the ’90s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because, you know, that’s always the language about immigrants, right? That they’re a drain on the economy, that they’re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live—even without a job—for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wow. Yeah, that is—that is a huge shift. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s huge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It sounds like it’s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes. That is an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;entirely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was everything from, you know, ”She doesn’t want to have sex ’til we get married. Is this a red flag?” “Is she affectionate enough?”  “Is she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?” Like, “Does she ask for money?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; was a big one that would come up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so, then, women, you know, didn’t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, “I feel, really, like I can’t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunte: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mmm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other’s actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually—or maybe facilitated—more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It’s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they’ll be deported—though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A beat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fiancé has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who’s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You’re asked about your American partner’s birthday, education, family—but you’re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you’re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you’re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heavy music plays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John, Colt’s cousin: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you express your love to Colt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;To show love? For me, it’s clean the house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The music continues under the narration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; question the would-be foreign spouse. Here’s Colt’s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The heavy music continues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m with him because I love him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larissa: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he’s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The news-show music fades out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffer: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it’s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it’s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lovesick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; repeats periodically, like a whisper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, Julia, what do you think?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.] this is, like, what’s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it’s kind of obvious that the foreign fiancé is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I’m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season—Jovi and Yara—and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they’re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, “Oh, what? You’re just going to go back to the Ukraine?” and she just looks at him and says, “Yeah! I’ll go back. I had a really nice life there!” And you can see that she’s, like, not here on a lark. She’s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know—and she knows there’s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she’s rejecting that. She’s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it’s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the “right reasons” to be in this kind of relationship—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;—or, really, any, right? (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chuckles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And why does the American government even care that much? [&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That’s all I have to say! (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;90 Day Fiancé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;? (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longoria: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mean, you watched it so I don’t have to!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunte: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laughs lightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bubblegum music plays up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC’s <a href="https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/90-day-fiance/"><em>90 Day Fiancé</em></a><em>, </em>a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn’t need to dream up a deadline: It’s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process. </p>
<p>The show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa—the “fiancé visa”—which allows a U.S. citizen’s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real.</p>
<p>“From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it’s intersecting with class and sexuality,” says <a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=fsg">Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</a>, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p><em>A transcript of this episode is presented below:</em></p>
<p>(<em>Playfully plucky marimba-and-horn music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Tracie Hunte: So, to begin, I am going to send you a link. It’s a little bit long—it’s like seven minutes or so—’cause this is your first time watching <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, anything having to do with <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, right?</p>
<p>Julia Longoria: That’s correct.</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Longoria: I’m just curious, like, <em>why</em> are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?</p>
<p>Hunte: (<em>Insistently.</em>) Watch the clip, Julia! (<em>Laughs, and Longoria joins in.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.</p>
<p>(<em>A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>is a wildly popular show on TLC. It’s about couples who are international—like, it’s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas—and I want to begin your <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.</p>
<p>Longoria: Okay. I’m gonna—do I hit play?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes. Hit play!</p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>My name is Colt. I’m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we’re at the airport, and we’re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas. </p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together—to Cancun, I think—and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.</p>
<p>Longoria: After one date they decided to get married?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we’re doing right now is that we’re meeting Larissa for the first time. She’s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.</p>
<p>Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes. </p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Here is hot. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>I don’t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It’s going to get a little hotter too. </em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: First of all, she’s hot. [<em>Longoria chuckles.</em>] It’s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I’ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [<em>Both laugh.</em>] and I know which one I vastly prefer.</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]</em></p>
<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I thought that was more big, you know.</em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>It’s pretty big.</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Like New York.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that’s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows—<em>Ocean’s 11</em>. Like, you get this idea that it’s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, “American dreams.” </p>
<p>Longoria: Totally.</p>
<p>Hunte: Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.</p>
<p>Hunte: Yeah.</p>
<p>Longoria: Like, casinos.</p>
<p>Hunte: Exactly.</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It’s not like the—the movies.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She’s still very hot. She’s still very uncomfortable. And she’s like, “Oh, here’s the sign!” And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It’s on postcards, it’s on magnets, it’s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, ’cause I also didn’t realize it was that small. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>No, no! I’m sorry. It’s—here’s so warm. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Yeah?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(Sighs.) Not in my American dream. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>This is America.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So yeah. I think that there’s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it’s, like, way bigger than that. </p>
<p>(<em>A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called <em>90 Day Fiancé?</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Well, it’s called <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>because, if you’re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fiancé visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days. </p>
<p>And so—at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I’m sure it’s different for a lot of couples—you’re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you <em>could</em> actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.</p>
<p>Longoria: So what you’re saying, like, <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>is a TV show based around this one piece—or, really, like, this one clause—in U.S. immigration policy?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes.</p>
<p>Longoria: I—I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I’ve always … The thing I don’t like about reality shows is that, like, they’re sort of contrived. It’s like, “Oh, 90 days to fall in love.” And it’s like, “That’s not the way the world works.” But, in this case, it is. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise. </p>
<p>Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven’t been watching reality TV, you’ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans’ relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.</p>
<p>(<em>Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law. </p>
<p>I’m Julia Longoria. This is <em>The Experiment</em>.</p>
<p>(<em>The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I’m Ed. I’m 54 years old. People know me as “Big Ed.”</em></p>
<p>(<em>Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I’m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name “Big Ed.”</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>It’s funny because I’m not tall. I am actually 4’11.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And then there’s Rose, who is much younger. She’s 23.</p>
<p>(<em>Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Rose Vega: </em><em>My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I’m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they’ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he’s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family—and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah, okay. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I spent the night at Rose’s home.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose’s house.</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I’m completely drained. I haven’t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I’ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Music fades out.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: (<em>As Hunte giggles.</em>) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.</p>
<p>Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what’s happening here.</p>
<p>Hunte: So, throughout the time that he’s in the Philippines, there’s, like, a scene where he’s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn’t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that’s what’s causing her breath, and she’s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego—something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he’s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she’s in. And he’s already been doing that. He’s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he’s in the Philippines, he’s <em>so</em> completely helpless, and <em>she’s</em> the one that ends up having to rescue <em>him</em> this entire trip.</p>
<p>Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it’s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.</p>
<p>(<em>Soft, lo-fi music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there’s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.</p>
<p>(<em>Music out.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: </em><em>Marriage is one of those ways in which women have—for many, many generations and decades—used marriage to get ahead. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She’s also the author of the book <em>Love and Empire. </em>Way before<em> 90 Day Fiancé, </em>Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um …</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wait, what’s a “vacation romance tour”? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Lightly bouncy music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So here’s what Felicity discovered. Say you’re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they’ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Their weight, how tall they are—all kinds of personal information—and then their contact.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And then, usually, they’ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it’s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Part of this that I’m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.</em></p>
<p><em>You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they’re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America—you know, wherever it is—Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don’t want to usually live in rural areas.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>What’d you see when you looked—when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it’s—it’s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don’t have some game. </em></p>
<p><em>I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, “You know, in the United States, I’m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.” </em></p>
<p><em>It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there’s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can’t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here. </em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Have you ever watched </em>90 Day Fiancé,<em> or heard about it?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>You watched it. Okay. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It’s hard to watch too many.</em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>(Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte’s narration.)</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Watching <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here’s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><em>Colt:</em><em> (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)</em></p>
<p>Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away … Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I’m 31 years old, and I’m from Mechanicsburg,</em> <em>Pennsylvania.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She’s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white. </p>
<p>While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that’s where I met Jay.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley says she’s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he’s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America. </p>
<p>But Ashley admits that she hasn’t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over slightly tense music.) I’m hoping we don’t have to deal with any racial issues, but I’m also very naive to all of this.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)</em> <em>If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don’t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don’t give a f***.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn’t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from <em>her</em> country.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>I don’t want him near me. I don’t even want him in this country. He’s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Low percussive music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Some of this ugliness—this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak—this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.</p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.</p>
<p>(<em>A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>A quick, goofy musical flourish.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: The journey to <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> is a long and winding one. As much as it’s a story about love across borders, it’s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer—she’s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours—told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, “immoral purposes.” And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants—but, more specifically, Chinese women.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Why were they having them do medical exams?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that’s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing—and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.</p>
<p>After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn’t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years—1945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers—who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.—started demanding a more permanent solution.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it’s like, “Wait, why are these women coming here?”</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. “What is their motivation for coming here?” I think that’s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.</em></p>
<p><em>Senator Alan Simpson: </em><em>We’re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here’s Senator Alan Simpson.</p>
<p><em>Simpson: </em><em>We’re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous—very generous—legal immigration laws.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn’t get a permanent green card until after you’d been married for at least two years.</p>
<p>Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the ’90s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Because, you know, that’s always the language about immigrants, right? That they’re a drain on the economy, that they’re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live—even without a job—for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wow. Yeah, that is—that is a huge shift. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah!</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>That’s huge. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>It sounds like it’s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. That is an </em>entirely<em> huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It was everything from, you know, ”She doesn’t want to have sex ’til we get married. Is this a red flag?” “Is she affectionate enough?”  “Is she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?” Like, “Does she ask for money?” </em>That<em> was a big one that would come up.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, then, women, you know, didn’t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, “I feel, really, like I can’t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.” </em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other’s actions.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually—or maybe facilitated—more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.</em></p>
<p>(<em>A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It’s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they’ll be deported—though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.</p>
<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fiancé has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who’s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You’re asked about your American partner’s birthday, education, family—but you’re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you’re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you’re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?</p>
<p>(<em>Heavy music plays.</em>)</p>
<p><em>John, Colt’s cousin: </em><em>How do you express your love to Colt?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>To show love? For me, it’s clean the house.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The music continues under the narration.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> question the would-be foreign spouse. Here’s Colt’s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.</p>
<p>(<em>The heavy music continues.</em>)</p>
<p><em>John: </em><em>You’re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I’m with him because I love him.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he’s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The news-show music fades out.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it’s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it’s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word </em>Lovesick<em> repeats periodically, like a whisper.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think?</p>
<p>Longoria: I mean, [<em>Laughs</em>.] this is, like, what’s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?</p>
<p>Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it’s kind of obvious that the foreign fiancé is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I’m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season—Jovi and Yara—and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they’re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, “Oh, what? You’re just going to go back to the Ukraine?” and she just looks at him and says, “Yeah! I’ll go back. I had a really nice life there!” And you can see that she’s, like, not here on a lark. She’s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know—and she knows there’s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she’s rejecting that. She’s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it’s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the “right reasons” to be in this kind of relationship—</p>
<p>Hunte: Yeah!</p>
<p>Longoria: —or, really, any, right? (<em>Chuckles.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [<em>Both laugh.</em>] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That’s all I have to say! (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>? (<em>Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don’t have to!</p>
<p>Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (<em>Laughs lightly.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>The bubblegum music plays up.</em>)</p>

Lessons From '90 Day Fiancé'</itunes:title><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Dating shows often push contestants to extreme measures in pursuit of love. Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC’s <a href="https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/90-day-fiance/"><em>90 Day Fiancé</em></a><em>, </em>a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn’t need to dream up a deadline: It’s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process. </p>
<p>The show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa—the “fiancé visa”—which allows a U.S. citizen’s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real.</p>
<p>“From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it’s intersecting with class and sexuality,” says <a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=fsg">Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</a>, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p><em>A transcript of this episode is presented below:</em></p>
<p>(<em>Playfully plucky marimba-and-horn music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Tracie Hunte: So, to begin, I am going to send you a link. It’s a little bit long—it’s like seven minutes or so—’cause this is your first time watching <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, anything having to do with <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, right?</p>
<p>Julia Longoria: That’s correct.</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Longoria: I’m just curious, like, <em>why</em> are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care?</p>
<p>Hunte: (<em>Insistently.</em>) Watch the clip, Julia! (<em>Laughs, and Longoria joins in.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV.</p>
<p>(<em>A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>is a wildly popular show on TLC. It’s about couples who are international—like, it’s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas—and I want to begin your <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa.</p>
<p>Longoria: Okay. I’m gonna—do I hit play?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes. Hit play!</p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>My name is Colt. I’m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we’re at the airport, and we’re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas. </p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together—to Cancun, I think—and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes.</p>
<p>Longoria: After one date they decided to get married?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we’re doing right now is that we’re meeting Larissa for the first time. She’s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions.</p>
<p>Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes. </p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Here is hot. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>I don’t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It’s going to get a little hotter too. </em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: First of all, she’s hot. [<em>Longoria chuckles.</em>] It’s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I’ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [<em>Both laugh.</em>] and I know which one I vastly prefer.</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.]</em></p>
<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I thought that was more big, you know.</em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>It’s pretty big.</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>Like New York.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that’s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows—<em>Ocean’s 11</em>. Like, you get this idea that it’s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, “American dreams.” </p>
<p>Longoria: Totally.</p>
<p>Hunte: Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights.</p>
<p>Hunte: Yeah.</p>
<p>Longoria: Like, casinos.</p>
<p>Hunte: Exactly.</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It’s not like the—the movies.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She’s still very hot. She’s still very uncomfortable. And she’s like, “Oh, here’s the sign!” And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It’s on postcards, it’s on magnets, it’s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, ’cause I also didn’t realize it was that small. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.)</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>No, no! I’m sorry. It’s—here’s so warm. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>Yeah?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(Sighs.) Not in my American dream. </em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>This is America.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So yeah. I think that there’s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it’s, like, way bigger than that. </p>
<p>(<em>A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called <em>90 Day Fiancé?</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Well, it’s called <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>because, if you’re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fiancé visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days. </p>
<p>And so—at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I’m sure it’s different for a lot of couples—you’re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you <em>could</em> actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with.</p>
<p>Longoria: So what you’re saying, like, <em>90 Day Fiancé </em>is a TV show based around this one piece—or, really, like, this one clause—in U.S. immigration policy?</p>
<p>Hunte: Yes.</p>
<p>Longoria: I—I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I’ve always … The thing I don’t like about reality shows is that, like, they’re sort of contrived. It’s like, “Oh, 90 days to fall in love.” And it’s like, “That’s not the way the world works.” But, in this case, it is. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise. </p>
<p>Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven’t been watching reality TV, you’ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [<em>Both laugh.</em>] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans’ relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans.</p>
<p>(<em>Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law. </p>
<p>I’m Julia Longoria. This is <em>The Experiment</em>.</p>
<p>(<em>The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed.</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I’m Ed. I’m 54 years old. People know me as “Big Ed.”</em></p>
<p>(<em>Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I’m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name “Big Ed.”</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>It’s funny because I’m not tall. I am actually 4’11.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And then there’s Rose, who is much younger. She’s 23.</p>
<p>(<em>Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Rose Vega: </em><em>My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I’m live in Caloocan City, Philippines.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they’ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he’s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family—and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah, okay. (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>I spent the night at Rose’s home.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose’s house.</p>
<p><em>Big Ed: </em><em>And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I’m completely drained. I haven’t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I’ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Music fades out.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: (<em>As Hunte giggles.</em>) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch.</p>
<p>Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what’s happening here.</p>
<p>Hunte: So, throughout the time that he’s in the Philippines, there’s, like, a scene where he’s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn’t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that’s what’s causing her breath, and she’s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego—something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he’s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she’s in. And he’s already been doing that. He’s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he’s in the Philippines, he’s <em>so</em> completely helpless, and <em>she’s</em> the one that ends up having to rescue <em>him</em> this entire trip.</p>
<p>Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it’s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans.</p>
<p>(<em>Soft, lo-fi music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there’s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship.</p>
<p>(<em>Music out.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: </em><em>Marriage is one of those ways in which women have—for many, many generations and decades—used marriage to get ahead. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She’s also the author of the book <em>Love and Empire. </em>Way before<em> 90 Day Fiancé, </em>Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um …</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wait, what’s a “vacation romance tour”? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.)</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Lightly bouncy music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So here’s what Felicity discovered. Say you’re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they’ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Their weight, how tall they are—all kinds of personal information—and then their contact.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And then, usually, they’ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it’s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Part of this that I’m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa.</em></p>
<p><em>You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they’re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America—you know, wherever it is—Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don’t want to usually live in rural areas.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>What’d you see when you looked—when you peered it into it? (Laughs.)</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it’s—it’s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don’t have some game. </em></p>
<p><em>I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, “You know, in the United States, I’m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.” </em></p>
<p><em>It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there’s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can’t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here. </em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Have you ever watched </em>90 Day Fiancé,<em> or heard about it?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.)</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>You watched it. Okay. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It’s hard to watch too many.</em></p>
<p><em>Colt: </em><em>(Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte’s narration.)</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Watching <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here’s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><em>Colt:</em><em> (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.)</em></p>
<p>Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away … Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I’m 31 years old, and I’m from Mechanicsburg,</em> <em>Pennsylvania.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She’s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white. </p>
<p>While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that’s where I met Jay.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley says she’s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he’s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America. </p>
<p>But Ashley admits that she hasn’t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em><em> (Over slightly tense music.) I’m hoping we don’t have to deal with any racial issues, but I’m also very naive to all of this.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>(The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.)</em> <em>If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don’t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don’t give a f***.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn’t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from <em>her</em> country.</p>
<p><em>Ashley: </em><em>I don’t want him near me. I don’t even want him in this country. He’s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Low percussive music plays.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Some of this ugliness—this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak—this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV.</p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application.</p>
<p>(<em>A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>A quick, goofy musical flourish.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: The journey to <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> is a long and winding one. As much as it’s a story about love across borders, it’s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer—she’s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours—told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, “immoral purposes.” And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants—but, more specifically, Chinese women.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Why were they having them do medical exams?</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that’s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing—and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry.</p>
<p>After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn’t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years—1945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers—who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.—started demanding a more permanent solution.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it’s like, “Wait, why are these women coming here?”</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. “What is their motivation for coming here?” I think that’s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War.</em></p>
<p><em>Senator Alan Simpson: </em><em>We’re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud. </em></p>
<p>Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here’s Senator Alan Simpson.</p>
<p><em>Simpson: </em><em>We’re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous—very generous—legal immigration laws.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn’t get a permanent green card until after you’d been married for at least two years.</p>
<p>Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the ’90s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Because, you know, that’s always the language about immigrants, right? That they’re a drain on the economy, that they’re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live—even without a job—for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Wow. Yeah, that is—that is a huge shift. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah!</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>That’s huge. </em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>It sounds like it’s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Yes. That is an </em>entirely<em> huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>It was everything from, you know, ”She doesn’t want to have sex ’til we get married. Is this a red flag?” “Is she affectionate enough?”  “Is she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?” Like, “Does she ask for money?” </em>That<em> was a big one that would come up.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, then, women, you know, didn’t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, “I feel, really, like I can’t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.” </em></p>
<p><em>Hunte: </em><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other’s actions.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually—or maybe facilitated—more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state.</em></p>
<p>(<em>A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It’s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005.</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights.</em></p>
<p>Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they’ll be deported—though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable.</p>
<p>(<em>A beat.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fiancé has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who’s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You’re asked about your American partner’s birthday, education, family—but you’re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you’re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you’re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person?</p>
<p>(<em>Heavy music plays.</em>)</p>
<p><em>John, Colt’s cousin: </em><em>How do you express your love to Colt?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>To show love? For me, it’s clean the house.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The music continues under the narration.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> question the would-be foreign spouse. Here’s Colt’s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt.</p>
<p>(<em>The heavy music continues.</em>)</p>
<p><em>John: </em><em>You’re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya?</em></p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>I’m with him because I love him.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Larissa: </em><em>(In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he’s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me.</em></p>
<p>(<em>The news-show music fades out.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Schaeffer: </em><em>The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it’s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it’s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones.</em></p>
<p>(<em>Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word </em>Lovesick<em> repeats periodically, like a whisper.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think?</p>
<p>Longoria: I mean, [<em>Laughs</em>.] this is, like, what’s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love?</p>
<p>Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it’s kind of obvious that the foreign fiancé is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I’m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season—Jovi and Yara—and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they’re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, “Oh, what? You’re just going to go back to the Ukraine?” and she just looks at him and says, “Yeah! I’ll go back. I had a really nice life there!” And you can see that she’s, like, not here on a lark. She’s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know—and she knows there’s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she’s rejecting that. She’s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it’s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be.</p>
<p>Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the “right reasons” to be in this kind of relationship—</p>
<p>Hunte: Yeah!</p>
<p>Longoria: —or, really, any, right? (<em>Chuckles.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [<em>Both laugh.</em>] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That’s all I have to say! (<em>Laughs.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.</em>)</p>
<p>Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>? (<em>Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.</em>)</p>
<p>Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don’t have to!</p>
<p>Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (<em>Laughs lightly.</em>)</p>

Reality-show producers will impose fake deadlines, physical obstacles, and manufactured drama to create the juiciest spectacle. But on TLC’s 90 Day Fiancé, a high-stakes and wildly popular reality show, the producers didn’t need to dream up a deadline: It’s a requirement of the rigorous U.S. visa-application process.  The show follows real-life couples pursuing a K-1 visa—the “fiancé visa”—which allows a U.S. citizen’s foreign partner to enter the U.S. legally, but only for 90 days, the deadline by which they must get married. The show documents the complications of those emotionally charged 90 days, when two people from different countries, cultures, and sometimes races have to decide whether their relationship is real. “From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race as it’s intersecting with class and sexuality,” says Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, a professor of feminist studies and critical race studies at UC Santa Cruz.

It’s a little bit long—it’s like seven minutes or so—’cause this is your first time watching 90 Day Fiancé, anything having to do with 90 Day Fiancé, right? Julia Longoria: That’s correct. Hunte: Okay, okay. Longoria: I’m just curious, like, why are you interested in this? Like, why should someone care? Hunte: (Insistently.) Watch the clip, Julia! (Laughs, and Longoria joins in.) (Music shifts into long, sustained notes to build drama.) Longoria: We start today with correspondent Tracie Hunte guiding me into the unknown: the world of reality TV. (A dramatic but upbeat musical flourish plays, like the intro to a theme song, before moving back to the plucky, quirky music.) Hunte: Okay. So, Julia, 90 Day Fiancé is a wildly popular show on TLC. It’s about couples who are international—like, it’s usually one person lives in America, and the other person lives somewhere overseas—and I want to begin your 90 Day Fiancé journey with one couple in particular: Colt and Larissa. Longoria: Okay. I’m gonna—do I hit play? Hunte: Yes. Hit play! Colt: My name is Colt. I’m 33 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hunte: We are in Las Vegas, Nevada, and we’re at the airport, and we’re meeting Colt and Larissa. Colt is a white guy in his 30s. He lives in Las Vegas.  Larissa: I am Larissa, 31 years old, from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Hunte: And Larissa is from Brazil. She is also in her 30s. And they met online. They went on vacation together—to Cancun, I think—and after five days of this vacation together, Colt asked Larissa to marry him. And so she said yes. Longoria: After one date they decided to get married? Hunte: Yes, effectively one date. So what we’re doing right now is that we’re meeting Larissa for the first time. She’s just flown into Las Vegas, and this scene is basically her first impressions. Longoria: First impressions of Las Vegas, right? Hunte: Yes.  Larissa: Here is hot.  Colt: I don’t have air-conditioning. [A chuckle.] It’s going to get a little hotter too.  Larissa: Oh my. I can feel the hot, warm. Hunte: First of all, she’s hot. [Longoria chuckles.] It’s not the same sort of warmth in Brazil. I’ve been to Brazil; I know the difference between desert heat and beach heat, [Both laugh.] and I know which one I vastly prefer. Larissa: My first goal in America is marry. Second, apply for the green card. And third, buy a car with air conditioner. [Laughs.] (A beat.) Larissa: I thought that was more big, you know. Colt: It’s pretty big. Larissa: Like New York. (Up-tempo, jazzy, big-city ambience plays.) Hunte: Las Vegas is also this thing that’s exported to the rest of the world through our movies and television shows—Ocean’s 11. Like, you get this idea that it’s this glamorous, glitzy, big city, you know, “American dreams.”  Longoria: Totally. Hunte: Blah, blah, blah. Longoria: Totally. Tall buildings, big lights. Hunte: Yeah. Longoria: Like, casinos. Hunte: Exactly. Larissa: My first impressions of Las Vegas? Not a city I expected. I confused Las Vegas with Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York. It’s not like the—the movies. Hunte: And so you see her, like, get out of the car. She’s still very hot. She’s still very uncomfortable. And she’s like, “Oh, here’s the sign!” And this is the world-famous Las Vegas sign. It’s on postcards, it’s on magnets, it’s everywhere. And it was actually surprising to me, ’cause I also didn’t realize it was that small. (Laughs.) Colt: Are you going back to Brazil? (Chuckles.) Larissa: No, no! I’m sorry. It’s—here’s so warm.  Colt: Yeah? Larissa: (Sighs.) Not in my American dream.  Colt: This is America. (Melodramatic, heavy piano music plays for a moment.) Hunte: So yeah. I think that there’s just a lot more going on here other than just, like, a disappointed woman coming from Brazil. I think it’s, like, way bigger than that.  (A musical descent pulls us into a dreamlike tapestry of synthesizers and percussion.) Longoria: Okay, back me up for a second. Why is the show called 90 Day Fiancé? Hunte: Well, it’s called 90 Day Fiancé because, if you’re an American person who wants to marry somebody from another country and you want to bring them to the United States, you can bring them to the United States on something called a K-1 visa, or a fiancé visa. And that gives that person permission to come to the United States to get married, but they have to do it within 90 days.  And so—at least, how it functions in the world of the TV show; I’m sure it’s different for a lot of couples—you’re going to spend those 90 days not only planning a wedding, but just, like, getting to know each other better, and figuring out whether or not you could actually live together, and whether or not this is what you want to go through with. Longoria: So what you’re saying, like, 90 Day Fiancé is a TV show based around this one piece—or, really, like, this one clause—in U.S. immigration policy? Hunte: Yes. Longoria: I—I did not realize that. [Hunte laughs.] Like, I guess I’ve always … The thing I don’t like about reality shows is that, like, they’re sort of contrived. It’s like, “Oh, 90 days to fall in love.” And it’s like, “That’s not the way the world works.” But, in this case, it is. [Both laugh.] It literally is how the world works. Like, the U.S. government came up with this premise.  Hunte: Yes! Yes. And, Julia, because you haven’t been watching reality TV, you’ve been missing a very important lesson about U.S. immigration policy. [Both laugh.] And I think this show is also, like, a really good textbook example of Americans’ relationship with the world, and how the world sees Americans. (Tonal shift: The music loops over the same few notes, hovering.) Longoria: This week, correspondent Tracie Hunte, our resident reality-TV expert, watches one of the biggest shows on television and tells the story of how love got written into U.S. immigration law.  I’m Julia Longoria. This is The Experiment. (The notes hover for a moment more before cutting out.) Hunte: Okay. So, new couple. This is Big Ed. Big Ed: I’m Ed. I’m 54 years old. People know me as “Big Ed.” (Fast-paced plucky guitar music plays.) Big Ed: I’m from San Diego, California. [A camera shutter clicks.] And I am a professional photographer. Hunte: Big Ed, American white man in his 50s. He actually gave himself the name “Big Ed.” Big Ed: It’s funny because I’m not tall. I am actually 4’11. Hunte: And then there’s Rose, who is much younger. She’s 23. (Whimsical, reality-TV-show-style music plays, ostensibly to play up the comedy of the circumstances.) Rose Vega: My name is Rose, and I am 23 years old. I’m live in Caloocan City, Philippines. Hunte: They met on Facebook, and they’ve had their relationship just on Facebook, and, like, texting and calling. And he’s traveling to the Philippines to meet her and her family—and hopefully fall ever more deeply in love with her, and ask her to marry him. Longoria: Yeah, okay. (Laughs.) Big Ed: I spent the night at Rose’s home. Hunte: And in this scene, Big Ed is waking up after spending the night in Rose’s house. Big Ed: And this was one of the worst nights of my life. I’m completely drained. I haven’t slept. The mattress that I slept in was soaking wet. This was the first night I’ve ever spent without access to air-conditioning. And I hated it. And I feel broken. (Music fades out.) Longoria: (As Hunte giggles.) This is just so, so deeply uncomfortable to watch. Hunte: So, like, a lot of this show is cringe. I should just say. Longoria: Yeah. So walk me through what’s happening here. Hunte: So, throughout the time that he’s in the Philippines, there’s, like, a scene where he’s asking her to shave her legs, because he doesn’t find her feminine enough for him. Or he makes a comment about her breath and gives her toothpaste and a toothbrush, but then it comes out that she actually has had an ulcer for many years, and that’s what’s causing her breath, and she’s actually self-conscious about it, and she brushes her teeth all the time. But, on top of all that, Ed travels to the Philippines from San Diego—something like six, seven thousand miles. And he goes because he’s gonna rescue Rose from this situation, this poverty that she’s in. And he’s already been doing that. He’s been, like, sending money to her and her family to help them out. But, from the second that he’s in the Philippines, he’s so completely helpless, and she’s the one that ends up having to rescue him this entire trip. Why I find this so interesting is just, you know, to see this kind of power dynamic play out. And, also, like, it’s just also really interesting to see the disconnect between how Americans see themselves and how the rest of the world sees Americans. (Soft, lo-fi music plays.) Hunte: And so on this show, you see men like Big Ed. They say they lost hope that they could ever find a partner in the U.S., so they turned to international dating. And this is not just, like, some bizarre reality-TV show setup. Like, there’s a whole industry built around this kind of relationship. (Music out.) Felicity Amaya Schaeffer: Marriage is one of those ways in which women have—for many, many generations and decades—used marriage to get ahead.  Hunte: Felicity Amaya Schaeffer is a professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race Studies at UC Santa Cruz. She’s also the author of the book Love and Empire. Way before 90 Day Fiancé, Felicity became interested in how immigrants were using marriage to cross the border into the U.S. Over three years, she talked to dozens of men and women who were interested in these kinds of relationships. Schaeffer: I ended up in Colombia and Mexico, interviewing women and men at these vacation romance tours about why they were interested in dating someone. Um … Hunte: Wait, what’s a “vacation romance tour”? (Schaeffer chuckles lightly while Hunte laughs outright.) Schaeffer: So, that is, um, these sort of big social parties that different companies host so that men from the United States and Canada can travel to Latin American countries and meet women in a big social event. (Lightly bouncy music plays.) Hunte: So here’s what Felicity discovered. Say you’re a woman in a foreign country interested in marrying an American man. You might contact one of these international dating sites, and they’ll get some photos of you and include some of your stats. Schaeffer: Their weight, how tall they are—all kinds of personal information—and then their contact. Hunte: The company then compiles these packages filled with these photos and contact info for all these women into these digital catalogs, and American men can look through them. And if they see someone they like, they could email them. Schaeffer: And then, usually, they’ll all come together for these big sort of social parties. And it’s a quick way to meet lots of women and for the women to be introduced to lots of men, all in one place.  Hunte: Which is where Felicity would show up, asking questions. Schaeffer: Part of this that I’m also interested in is the fantasies that foreign women usually have of life in the United States, and vice versa. You know, men sort of think that U.S. women are much too feminist and too modern and too independent. And they think that they’re gonna find something very different in Russia, Latin America—you know, wherever it is—Asia. And so they often are surprised that women, um, are very strong, have strong personalities, they need certain things, and that they don’t want to usually live in rural areas. Hunte: Did you peer into the dark heart of American masculinity? Schaeffer: Yes. Hunte: What’d you see when you looked—when you peered it into it? (Laughs.) Schaeffer: Oh my God, I mean, so many insecurities! Given the way in which desire is so entwined with status and money, you know, it’s—it’s a sad structure, that sort of capitalist context in which certain people become no one if you don’t have some game.  I have this amazing interview with a guy who said to me something that really clarified things. He said, “You know, in the United States, I’m just the average Joe. But when I cross the border, I become Tom Cruise.”  It was hard, in some ways, and I felt really creepy. And then it was also sad, you know, to see that there’s so many lonely people that are just sort of in the shadows, um, that can’t meet anyone and just, like, really want to connect. Hunte: Hmm. Schaeffer: And these women are just desperate to come to the United States. And that the men, in some ways, broker their ticket to getting here.  Hunte: Have you ever watched 90 Day Fiancé, or heard about it? Schaeffer: Yes. I have watched some of the episodes, of course! (Laughs.) Hunte: You watched it. Okay.  Schaeffer: It’s hard to watch too many. Colt: (Over funky music.) I never thought I would get married. All my previous relationships have ended with me getting a broken heart. (The funky music continues under Hunte’s narration.) Hunte: Watching 90 Day Fiancé, I got this feeling that, for a lot of the cast, they might actually believe that a shot at the American dream is all they have to offer in exchange for love. Here’s Colt, the guy who lives in Las Vegas. Colt: (Over the funky music again.) After having struck out a few times online with American girls, I thought maybe I could search outside the country, maybe find a girl. (The music fades out.) Hunte: But, as Americans put themselves on the international marriage market hoping to find someone more beautiful, more loyal, more grateful, if that love turns out not to be true, they also have the power to take that American dream away … Which brings me to one couple I think about a lot: Ashley and Jay. Ashley: (Over soft-rock acoustic guitar.) My name is Ashley. I’m 31 years old, and I’m from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Hunte: Ashley is in her 30s. She’s white, blond, pretty, and a mother of two from Mechanicsburg, a town in Pennsylvania where more than 90 percent of the residents are white.  While vacationing in Jamaica, she meets Jay, a Black, 20-year-old tattoo artist. Ashley: (Over lightly techno music.) I went to Jamaica with a group of friends and family to a big wedding. And, um, one night we decided to go out to a bar, and that’s where I met Jay. Hunte: Ashley says she’s been cheated on before, and Jay more or less admits that being faithful is hard for him. But when he proposes, she says yes. They file for the K-1 visa, and soon he’s on a plane, traveling to live with her in America.  But Ashley admits that she hasn’t really thought about what that might mean for Jay, to live in a mostly white suburb. Ashley: (Over slightly tense music.) I’m hoping we don’t have to deal with any racial issues, but I’m also very naive to all of this. Hunte: Ashley and Jay get married, but shortly after the wedding, she finds out he had sex with another woman. So she calls him on the phone to confront him. Ashley: (The tense music continues, adding drama with each expletive.) If you show up at my house, the police will be waiting to deport your ass. I don’t give a f***. I do not give a f***. He has to sit and rot in jail until they deport his ass. I don’t give a f***. Hunte: And, just like that, Ashley goes from being this naive white woman who doesn’t understand race in America to a white woman asking the police to remove her disappointing Black, immigrant husband from her life, and from her country. Ashley: I don’t want him near me. I don’t even want him in this country. He’s here illegally. He needs to go back to Jamaica. (Low percussive music plays.) Hunte: Some of this ugliness—this icky gender and racial dynamics, the heartbreak—this is just classic reality-TV-show stuff. But this particular drama of the 90 days and the K-1 visa started way before reality TV. Hunte: For one thing, I, you know, I just kind of looked at the Wikipedia history of the K-1 visa, and I was kind of surprised to see that [Chuckles.] the Vietnam War had something to do with it. Schaeffer: Yeah. I mean, it actually has a lot longer history, I would say, than the Vietnam War. Hunte: After the break, how love got turned into a visa application. (A moment of synthesizer melody plays above the percussive music, followed by the break.) (A quick, goofy musical flourish.) Hunte: The journey to 90 Day Fiancé is a long and winding one. As much as it’s a story about love across borders, it’s also a mini-drama about who we think is worthy of marriage and citizenship, and who has the power to decide. Felicity Amaya Schaeffer—she’s the professor at UC Santa Cruz who did research on so-called romance tours—told us that one of the earliest immigration laws ever passed in the U.S. was about romance, or, at least, sex. Schaeffer: From the very moment that the federal government became involved in immigration, you see the influence of biases of race.  Hunte: The law was called the Page Act, passed in 1875. It restricted the migration of Asian laborers to the United States for, quote, “immoral purposes.” And it was primarily enforced against Chinese immigrants—but, more specifically, Chinese women. Schaeffer: If you were the wife of a wealthy Chinese merchant, you could come to the United States. But, if you were a lower-class woman, you could not come. And this has to do with trying to prevent laborers from migrating and bringing women that they thought would destroy the values of the United States.  Hunte: U.S. lawmakers assumed that poor Chinese women coming to the United States were coming here to be sex workers. Schaeffer: This created some of the legislation that women had to have medical examinations before migrating. Hunte: Why were they having them do medical exams? Schaeffer: Chinese women were assumed to spread venereal diseases because they were assumed to be prostitutes. Women had to have that kind of medical exam before they were allowed entry. (Light, ringing synthesizer music seems to travel back in time.) Hunte: The law was eventually changed to allow more foreign women into the United States, but that’s because American men demanded it. Starting with the Philippines War in the late 1800s, American men were going all over the world, fighting wars and colonizing—and, in the meantime, meeting women they wanted to bring back to the U.S. and marry. After World War II, thousands of American men wanted to bring women back from Europe and Asia, but couldn’t, because of immigration quotas. So Congress passed the War Brides Act. Schaeffer: This was a kind of pathway for men to bring back wives. And there was, like, 300,000 women that came. Hunte: It made it easier to bring the spouses of American military members back to the U.S. But the War Brides Act was only in effect for about three years—1945 to 1948. And as the Vietnam War began to wind down, American soldiers—who, once again, wanted to bring more foreign wives back to the U.S.—started demanding a more permanent solution. Schaeffer: So 1970 was when the K-1 process was actually finalized.  Hunte: But the relatively clear, simple, and quick path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship offered by the K-1 visa has alarmed American politicians over the years, and led to panics about marriage fraud. Schaeffer: There were all kinds of media accounts about these sort of marriage-ring frauds that were allowing people to come in from Havana, and all these subversive types that were using marriage as a way to sort of skirt the usual immigration structures and enter into the country. And I think during the wars, it was a more clear understanding of how people met, and the conditions through which people met. Hunte: So the soldiers were going overseas, falling in love, bringing women back. Now, when in the absence of that, it’s like, “Wait, why are these women coming here?” Schaeffer: Mhm, mhm! [Hunte laughs.] Yeah! Yeah. “What is their motivation for coming here?” I think that’s the next big phase, is already the presumption of fraud after the Vietnam War. Senator Alan Simpson: We’re going to examine this issue of immigration marriage fraud.  Hunte: Resulting in things like this: a Senate committee hearing on marriage fraud in 1985. Here’s Senator Alan Simpson. Simpson: We’re going to inquire into the nature and extent of this situation, determine whether we see but another way of gimmicking our generous—very generous—legal immigration laws. Hunte: And this led to a new immigration law. It made the green card immigrants got after they got married conditional. You didn’t get a permanent green card until after you’d been married for at least two years. Suspicion of immigrants continued well into the ’90s, but the narrative changed to one where immigrants were now an economic liability. Schaeffer: Because, you know, that’s always the language about immigrants, right? That they’re a drain on the economy, that they’re always taking from and, you know, using these precious resources that should go to citizens. Hunte: So the K-1 visa changed again. In 1996, President Clinton signed a new rule into law. Starting now, Americans who brought a spouse to the U.S. on the K-1 visa were now legally responsible for that person for 10 years. Schaeffer: Even if they divorce, he is taking up responsibility to make sure that she can live—even without a job—for the remainder of 10 years while in this country, if she decides to stay. Hunte: Wow. Yeah, that is—that is a huge shift.  Schaeffer: Yeah! Hunte: That’s huge.  Schaeffer: Yeah. Hunte: It sounds like it’s to discourage people from doing this, is what it sounds like. Schaeffer: Yes. That is an entirely huge shift, and men came to me complaining about that [Laughs.] over and over again. Hunte: As part of her research, Felicity spent a lot of time on listservs for men interested in marrying foreign women. When this rule was put into place, she watched as they began to freak out, asking each other about potential red flags. Schaeffer: It was everything from, you know, ”She doesn’t want to have sex ’til we get married. Is this a red flag?” “Is she affectionate enough?”  “Is she, uh, hot and sexy in bed?” Like, “Does she ask for money?” That was a big one that would come up. And so, then, women, you know, didn’t have the benefit of this kind of community, but would often talk to me, like, “I feel, really, like I can’t ask him for things that I need, because he seems so suspicious of me.”  Hunte: Mmm. Schaeffer: So, you know, it really did affect, um, what they could say to each other, how they would read each other’s actions. Hunte: Felicity says the threat of financial consequences for a bad marriage with a foreign spouse may have made these kinds of relationships even more tense. Schaeffer: And so I think that part of that shift in the K-1 visa structure led to, actually—or maybe facilitated—more abusive relationships, because the men were so skeptical and sort of adopting the view of the state. (A heavy synthesizer whistle plays over a windswept musical landscape.) Hunte: In 2000, Anastasia King, a 19-year-old originally from Kyrgyzstan, was murdered by her American husband after she was brought to the U.S. on the K-1 visa. It’s impossible to say for certain whether the pressure and suspicion that increased after changes to the K-1 visa increased the level of violence in these kinds of relationships. But, in response to this abuse, Congress realized it also had to protect immigrant spouses. So it passed the International Marriage Brokerage Regulation Act, or IMBRA, in 2005. Schaeffer: Where men have to provide criminal records, and women have to have their rights. Hunte: I spoke to a couple of immigration attorneys who told me immigrant women are still afraid that, if they report their American husbands for abuse, they’ll be deported—though there are provisions within IMBRA and the Violence Against Women Act to protect them. Even still, women in the U.S. on the K-1 visa, separated from family and community and unable to legally work, are often left vulnerable. (A beat.) Hunte: Today, as part of the K-1 application process, the foreign fiancé has to sit for an interview with an American consular official who’s trying to find out whether your relationship is real or a scam. You’re asked about your American partner’s birthday, education, family—but you’re also asked to maybe describe your engagement, or whether you’re planning to go on a honeymoon, or what kind of wedding you’re going to have. In other words, are you here for the right reasons? Do you really love this person? (Heavy music plays.) John, Colt’s cousin: How do you express your love to Colt? Larissa: To show love? For me, it’s clean the house. (The music continues under the narration.) Hunte: Those interviews with consular officials are never caught on camera. But you can kind of get an idea of how they might go, watching friends and family on 90 Day Fiancé question the would-be foreign spouse. Here’s Colt’s cousin, John, asking Larissa to prove she loves Colt. (The heavy music continues.) John: You’re not just coming over here to marry my man for a green card, are ya? Larissa: I’m with him because I love him. (The music changes tone, like an investigative journalist intro on a late-night news show.) Larissa: (In a confessional interview.) Honestly, John was acting like he’s policy or immigration officer. He was really rude to me. (The news-show music fades out.) Schaeffer: The United States is about choice and equality and democracy. So it’s interesting to think about how romance sort of sits in for all of these other values of a democracy. Like, are you capable of consenting to this? Or, if you come from a poor background, are you forced into this because you have no other recourse? That you really choose this person because you love them, and not for any other reasons. So it’s this sort of divorcing of economic questions from romantic ones. (Soft, pensive electric guitar plays over lo-fi electronica. The word Lovesick repeats periodically, like a whisper.) Hunte: So, Julia, what do you think? Longoria: I mean, [Laughs.] this is, like, what’s so appealing and repulsing about reality TV, right? Watching this desperation on all sides play out like a car accident, you know? Are they here for the right reasons? Will they actually be truly in love? Hunte: You know, there are, like, some couples on the show where it’s kind of obvious that the foreign fiancé is, like, only here for that person, and it kind of plays out in these funny ways. Like, I’m thinking about this one couple from the most recent season—Jovi and Yara—and Yara is from the Ukraine, and Jovi is an American guy from New Orleans. And they’re having a fight on the street, and, at one point, Jovi says, “Oh, what? You’re just going to go back to the Ukraine?” and she just looks at him and says, “Yeah! I’ll go back. I had a really nice life there!” And you can see that she’s, like, not here on a lark. She’s not here because she thinks that the United States is better than the Ukraine. She actually, you know—and she knows there’s a stereotype about eastern European women, and she’s rejecting that. She’s just literally here to be with this guy. So I just also like this show because it’s always questioning your assumptions about people and what their motivations might be. Longoria: Yeah! And it kind of raises the question, like, what are the “right reasons” to be in this kind of relationship— Hunte: Yeah! Longoria: —or, really, any, right? (Chuckles.) Hunte: And why does the American government even care that much? [Both laugh.] You know, if people are scamming, let them scam each other and fall in love. That’s all I have to say! (Laughs.) (Upbeat, bubblegum techno music plays up.) Hunte: I already think I know the answer to this question, but, Julia, do you think you will watch 90 Day Fiancé? (Bursts out laughing, and Longoria laughs too.) Longoria: I mean, you watched it so I don’t have to! Hunte: Alright! Fair enough, fair enough. (Laughs lightly.) (The bubblegum music plays up.)

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/04/felony-murder-police-accountability/618703/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One night in the spring of 2005, Anissa Jordan was sitting in a car in San Francisco while her boyfriend attempted to rob a young man nearby. Shortly after, police arrested both Anissa and her boyfriend. Anissa was detained and dressed in an orange jumpsuit before she learned that the young man had been shot and killed that night and that she and her boyfriend would both be held responsible. The charge: felony murder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The felony-murder rule, which exists in more than 40 states, allows prosecutors to charge accomplices to certain crimes, such as conspiracy to commit robbery, with murder, even if they didn’t intend to kill—and even if they weren’t present for the murder. It does so by removing intent to kill from the calculus of what makes a murderer. Critics say the rule has disproportionately led to the incarceration of youth of color and women, such as Anissa, but some prosecutors say the felony-murder rule is the key to holding police officers responsible in the killings of civilians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By propping up this terrible rule, however we do it, we have to understand this rule is primarily used against Black people and people of color,” says Kate Chatfield, a director at the Justice Collaborative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a look at the doctrine that prosecutors used to convict Anissa for a crime she didn’t even witness, and a debate over whether that same rule is crucial to prosecuting the highest-profile case in the country, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The State of Minnesota v. Derek Chauvin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Shortly after, police arrested both Anissa and her boyfriend. Anissa was detained and dressed in an orange jumpsuit before she learned that the young man had been shot and killed that night and that she and her boyfriend would both be held responsible. The charge: felony murder.</p>
<p>The felony-murder rule, which exists in more than 40 states, allows prosecutors to charge accomplices to certain crimes, such as conspiracy to commit robbery, with murder, even if they didn’t intend to kill—and even if they weren’t present for the murder. It does so by removing intent to kill from the calculus of what makes a murderer. Critics say the rule has disproportionately led to the incarceration of youth of color and women, such as Anissa, but some prosecutors say the felony-murder rule is the key to holding police officers responsible in the killings of civilians.</p>
<p>“By propping up this terrible rule, however we do it, we have to understand this rule is primarily used against Black people and people of color,” says Kate Chatfield, a director at the Justice Collaborative. </p>
<p>This week on <em>The Experiment</em>, a look at the doctrine that prosecutors used to convict Anissa for a crime she didn’t even witness, and a debate over whether that same rule is crucial to prosecuting the highest-profile case in the country, <em>The State of Minnesota v.

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/04/national-parks-native-americans/618574/?preview=nt6XmOPb2Hxv5v6NBAbyAWTG4c0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The national-park system has been touted as &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/americasbestidea/"&gt;“America’s best idea.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.davidtreuer.net/"&gt;David Treuer&lt;/a&gt;, an Ojibwe author and historian, says we can make that idea even better—by giving national parks back to Native Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By virtue of the parks returning to Native control, I would like people, when they’re standing at the foot of El Capitan, to look up knowing they’re on Native lands, to look up knowing that they’re standing on the graves of Native people,” says Treuer, who grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota as the nearby Voyageurs National Park was being established. “I would like, when people look up at vistas, like at Yosemite or at Yellowstone, that they’d look up as a way to look back at the history of this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treuer, who wrote the book &lt;a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781594633157"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America From 1890 to the Present&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; says that Native Americans are too often precluded from using the land in culturally significant ways that go back millennia. In &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/05/return-the-national-parks-to-the-tribes/618395/"&gt;his essay for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he makes the case that the U.S. should return control of national parks to its Native people.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/04/rock-doc-opioid-prescribe/618453/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The patients of the nurse practitioner and aspiring reality star Jeffrey Young say he helped them like nobody else could. Federal prosecutors who charged him in a massive opioid bust say he overprescribed painkillers, often for “money, notoriety, and sexual favors.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Young’s case provides a rare glimpse into the ways patients wind up addicted to the powerful painkillers fueling the national opioid epidemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Branding himself “the Rock Doc” in a self-produced reality-TV pilot, Young would wear band T-shirts and blast music as he met with patients; he sometimes broadcast appointments and medical procedures on the live-streaming app Periscope. Off camera, Young allegedly prescribed 1.4 million addictive pills and had sex with female patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Young was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/crime/2019/04/17/jackson-bells-medical-professionals-federal-drug-trafficking-charges-opioids/3496310002/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicted on drug-trafficking charges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in April 2019. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and is currently in jail awaiting trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why would you go to this doctor? Why didn’t anyone try to put a stop to this?’ I just had a lot of questions about how could this happen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Federal prosecutors who charged him in a massive opioid bust say he overprescribed painkillers, often for “money, notoriety, and sexual favors.”  Young’s case provides a rare glimpse into the ways patients wind up addicted to the powerful painkillers fueling the national opioid epidemic. Branding himself “the Rock Doc” in a self-produced reality-TV pilot, Young would wear band T-shirts and blast music as he met with patients; he sometimes broadcast appointments and medical procedures on the live-streaming app Periscope. Off camera, Young allegedly prescribed 1.4 million addictive pills and had sex with female patients. Young was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in April 2019. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and is currently in jail awaiting trial. “I had a lot of ‘Why on earth?’ questions,” the Atlantic reporter Olga Khazan says. “‘Why would he do this?

</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/03/jacobson-supreme-court-vaccination/618359/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1902, a Swedish American pastor named Henning Jacobson refused to get the smallpox vaccine. This launched a chain of events that landed the Massachusetts pastor in a landmark 1905 Supreme Court case in which the Court considered the delicate balancing act between individual liberty over our bodies and our duty to one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We can be grateful for his work here [while] at the same time also saying the dude was terribly mistaken about this one thing for which, unfortunately, he's most famous now,” says Pastor Robin Lutjohann, who today leads the church that Jacobson founded, originally a haven for Swedish immigrants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision made clear that the government could mandate vaccination, arguing that collective good sometimes outweighs individual rights. But the line between the two is blurry. More than two decades after Jacobson’s case, the Court used the same logic in another decision, one the historian Michael Willrich says is among the “scariest U.S. Supreme Court decisions of all time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the “lost cause” myth—the idea that the Civil War was not about slavery but about northern aggression—still has a hold on countless Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The historian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/our-faculty/directory/faculty-detail/Ty-Seidule"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ty Seidule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; doesn’t believe that anymore, though he only came to the realization well into his career as an Army officer and a history professor. His book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250239266"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert E. Lee and Me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deconstructs the legacy of the top Confederate general and unpacks the enduring “lost cause” ideology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On this week’s episode of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the correspondent Tracie Hunte talked with Seidule about why unlearning the mythology surrounding Lee took him so long, and the host, Julia Longoria, considers what it might take for other white Americans to do the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a press conference late last March, Garcetti announced a new milestone: the first health-care worker in Los Angeles County to die of the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I heard him say that, I realized that he was talking about Auntie Rosary,” Jollene Levid says, speaking about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kanlungan.net/full-tributes/rosary-castro-olega"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosary Castro-Olega&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a 63-year-old nurse who came out of retirement to work in hospitals strained by the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Castro-Olega’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; death helped inspire an online memorial called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kanlungan.net/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kanlungan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which honors the lives of health-care workers of Filipino descent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Freedom Summer. &lt;span&gt;Marylin Thurman Newkirk&lt;/span&gt; was born in Greenwood, Mississippi, in a county where just about 250 Black adults out of more than 13,000 were registered to vote. She would grow up as part of the first generation of Americans who lived in a true democracy, according to her son &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/vann-newkirk/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vann R. Newkirk II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That has a lot to do with a law enacted a year after her birth, in 1965. That’s when Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which ended Jim Crow laws preventing Black people from voting in many states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the protections enacted in 1965 didn’t last, and today they’re hanging by a thread. Now, in the aftermath of his mother’s death at 56, Newkirk argues that the best way to ensure that democracy lasts is a constitutional amendment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
